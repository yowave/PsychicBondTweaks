Psychic Bond Tweaks for RimworldA Highmate walked into a colonyâ€¦ 

Your prayers have finally been answered with this Psychic Bond Tweaks Mod that allows better control over those pesky Highmates. 

No more Torn Bonds with negative mood buffs that bring you and your whole colony to your knees. No more dragging the delicate, peace-loving, but somehow useless partners across realms to avoid getting separation anxiety.

The Psychic Bond Tweaks Mod gives the power back to you. You can now customize the playthrough with Highmates to your liking. Change the buff/debuff values, create the ultimate buff-harem fit for an Emperor, and conveniently keep track of it all with separated hediffs for all your specific Bonds.

With the original Psychic Bond, you could only have one hediff, or Bond, active at a time while the consequent bonds would merge with the first one. This meant that you could only enjoy the benefits of 1 Bond at a time. With Psychic Bond Tweaks, you can have as many Highmates bonded to a singular Pawn as you want. This, of course, comes with a warning: All of your Debuffs (from Torn Bonds and Distance) apply separately, as well. Watch out for that Mental Break!

Should it happen, that your Pawn or Highmate dies, don't panic! The Psychic Bond Tweaks Mod has got you covered, and has ensured that your Bond will not break even after death. Once you resurrect your respective Pawns, the bond will be up and running as usual. You can tell the current state of the Bond handily from the Health Tab. 

And remember, once the Highmate bonds to a Pawn with this Mod active it will not bond to another Pawn again. Please store your deceased in the fridge for that magical, oh-so-touching reunion of the two completely consensual lovers!
